* interactive SSH to VM from mulch client

+ Oniti: Sparkpost

- create new key
- sort REST lists (ex: backups & vms)
- https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/bash_completions.md
- last N log lines buffer, seen by "mulch log" (useful for seeder messages)
- challenge based auth?
- mulchd should be able to run with a remote libvirtd (StoragePath disallow this, currently)
- support passphrase for Mulch SSH key
- move SSH Keys and MulchSuperUser to VM level?
- check for missing response.Body.Close() (or things like that)

- change HTTP code from 200 to 4XXX in controllers when things fails (ex: req.Stream.Failure)
    - in client, make the non-200 error message silent in stream mode?

- see if it's possible for a VM to steal an IP from another VM (DoS)
- create a specific HTTP muxer for /phone (only listening on mulch's virbr)

- deal with libvirtd restart
- check connection and access rights
- differentiate "rights issues" from  "libvirtd not running" issues
