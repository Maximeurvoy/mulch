- fix SSH proxy "end of connection"
- completion: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/bash_completions.md
- add 'env' to mulchd.toml? (overridden by VM's env directive)
- fix phpMyAdmin errors (done in 4.8, let's wait)
- 'vm infos' command: add disk size provisioned/real ? + domains ?
- "Update available" alert on client (info from server?)
- flag for compression / no compression on "vm backup"
- (big!) faster rebuild
- check 'nwfilter-dumpxml clean-traffic' / libvirt-daemon-config-nwfilter during install?
- https API
- challenge based auth?
- mulchd should be able to run with a remote libvirtd (StoragePath disallow this, currently)
- support passphrase for Mulch SSH key?
- move SSH Keys and MulchSuperUser to VM level?
- check for missing response.Body.Close() (or things like that)

- change HTTP code from 200 to 4XX in controllers when things fails (ex: req.Stream.Failure)
    - in client, make the non-200 error message silent in stream mode?

- create a specific HTTP muxer for /phone (only listening on mulch's virbr)
- hardening of <filterref filter='clean-traffic'> with fixed IP addr?

- re-check/update install script
- check connection and access rights
- differentiate "rights issues" from  "libvirtd not running" issues
