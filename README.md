# Mulch
Easy VM creation and management tool: velvet applications in an iron hypervisor

What is it?
---
Mulch is a light and practical virtual machine manager, it allows to create VMs and host applications in VM with a single command line and a simple description file. **You can see it as a simple KVM hardened container system**.

It's using libvirt API (KVM) and can share an existing libvirt server or use a
dedicated one. It features a client-server architecture using
a REST API. It's written in Go and use shell scripts to drive VM configuration and application installation. Base Linux images ("seeds") use Cloud-Init so almost every [OpenStack compliant image](https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html) will work out of the box. Default Mulch configuration provides seeds for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

It features an embedded high-performance HTTP / HTTP2 reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt certificate generation for VM hosted Web Application.

Mulh also provides an SSH proxy providing full access (ssh, scp, port forwarding, â€¦) to VMs for Mulch users.

Here is a minimal VM description file: (TOML format)
```toml
# This is a (working) minimalist sample VM definition
name = "mini"
seed = "debian_9"

disk_size = "20G"
ram_size = "1G"
cpu_count = 1
```
You can then create this VM with:
```sh
mulch vm create mini.toml
```

How do I install the client?
---
Usual Go requirements : check you have go/golang installed and `~/go/bin/` is in your `PATH` (or copy binary in one of your `PATH` directories).

Then install the client:
```sh
go get -u github.com/Xfennec/mulch/cmd/mulch
```

That's it, you can now run `mulch` command. It will show you a sample configuration file (`~/.mulch.toml`):
```toml
[[server]]
name = "my-mulch"
url = "http://192.168.10.104:8585"
key = "gein2xah7keeL33thpe9ahvaegF15TUL3surae3Chue4riokooJ5WuTI80FTWfz2"
```
Of course, you'll need to get your own API key / server URL.

How do I install the server? (mulchd and mulch-proxy)

Install:
 - libvirt daemon packages: libvirt-bin / libvirt(?)
 - development packages: libvirt-dev / libvirt-devel package needed
 - go get -u github.com/Xfennec/mulch/cmd/...
 - cd go/src/github.com/Xfennec/mulch
 - ./install.sh
